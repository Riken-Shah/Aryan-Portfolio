## Little about the project

- 👨‍🏫 This website is designed considering the principal UI/UX (ie. To increase engagement of the user) 👨‍🏫  
- 👨‍💻 I have used here modern animation and practices to make this site load faster and to look sleek 👨‍💻
- 💇‍♂️ I have also not used any css styling module like bootstrap or modern ui. All the css is written from scratch 💇‍♂️
- 💻 This website is completely responsive 💻
